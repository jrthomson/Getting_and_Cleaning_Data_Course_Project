The script run_analysis.R reads the experiment data and performs the following steps to get it into a tidy format:

1. Gets the data
2. Reads the data
3. Merges the data sets into one data set
4. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Uses descriptive activity names
6. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
7. Creates a tidy data set

The script requires the dplyr package.

Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each 
person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing 
a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 
70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
variables from the time and frequency domain.
